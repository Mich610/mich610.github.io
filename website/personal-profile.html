				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					A simple super comparison tool that will allow the user to compare super funds. In many cases a
					person will simply consolidate their funds into which ecver fund their employer is currently paying
					into, however this super fund may not be the most appropriate. In addition when these accounts are
					created they are often invested within a default option, which may not reflect the desired
					investment strategy. The user will be able to compare these multiple funds and consolidate into the
					most appropriate fund for their needs. It will also allow for a user with a single fund to compare
					different investment options.
				</p>

				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>
					Many young adults in particular millenials have been entering the workforce but often chaninging
					jobs and each time a new super fund was created. The government's 'Protecting your Super' scheme has
					helped to reduce the amount of Australian with multiple super funds. However, under this scheme
					funds were automatically consolidated into their existing active super fund which may may not be to
					most appropriate. Many of these young adults, think that planning for their retirement is not
					relevant as it is so far off, therefore they are not willing to seek or pay for professional advice.
					The aim is to help people with this frame of mind to organise their retirement savings without the
					pressure of paying for professional advice.
				</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					The user would first complete a risk profile questionnaire, there is no stock standard across the
					industry so one will need to be created that has simple and easy questions for the user. Followed by an
					explanation of the different risk tolerances and investment strategies. The user can select their risk
					profile based on the results of the questionnaire or simply by the descrption if they do not completely
					agree with the result. The selected profile will ensure that only investments with that profile are
					compared.
				</p>
				<p>
				The user to need to add their existing fund/s and input the current balance, investment option and any
				know contributions - ie super guarantee, salary sacrifice or member. The user can then select the super
				funds they wish to compare - this can be multiple funds if they are wanting to consolidate or one fund
				if they just wish to compare investments. The comparison will show:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The appropriate investments as per the selected risk profile.</li>
					<li>All fees and costs associated with the fund</li>
					<li>Death benefit nominations available (binding, non-binding, lapsing) an explanation of these nominations and the importance of them will also be included.</li>
					<li>Insurance available - (default cover or whether an amount can be chosen and any underwiriting	requirements)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For each selected super fund links will be included below the comparisons to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The website</li>
					<li>The Product Disclosure Statement (PDS)</li>
					<li>The forms page of the website - change of investment, consolidation/rollover, beneficiary , insurance	etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The idea is to make the comparison tool user friendly not Financial Planner friendly. If the user if
					overwhelmed by all the information, they may not understand what they are reading and make the wrong
					choice or they may just give up and not follow through. The basic information will be shown that will
					allow the user to make a decision with the links to provide further clarification if required.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Tool and Technologies</h3>
				<p>
					The proposed superannuation comparison tool needs to be easily discoverable and available for anybody
					with access to the internet and a modern web browser. Therefore the tool will predominently be built
					using web development technologies. In addition, the tool will also need to be:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mobile friendly across most modern mobile devices</li>
					<li>Usable with accessiblity tools (screen readers etc)</li>
					<li>Intuitive and easily understood user interface (i.e https://material.io/design/introduction)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					After some industry research, it seems there are quite a number of technologies to choose from in order
					to complete this project. An option for building this solution would be with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ReactJS - Facebook's Javascript UI framework (https://reactjs.org/)</li>
					<li>Bootstrap 4 - CSS styling framework (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)</li>
					<li>Github Pages - Free hosting service</li>
					<li>(optional) AWS Route53 - DNS provider to eventually host the tool under a marketable name</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>
					In order to build this tool in the above technologies, one would need to know:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML and Javascript with experience in React JS if possible</li>
					<li>CSS experience</li>
					<li>Git experience to work with hosting on Github pages</li>
					<li>(optional) Networking skills to set up hosting and domain name configuration</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>
					This comparison tool will allow people who are either not wanting to seek or cannot afford professional
					advice to gain a deeper understanding of their super funds. They can ensure their funds are invested in
					a product and manner they are comfotable with, putting themselves on a positive track until they are
					ready to receive professional financial advice.
