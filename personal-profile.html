        <p>
          The results of the three tests should be taken with a grain of salt. These types of results will never be 100%
          accurate, they are taken out of context at a random point in time. I have previously taken the Myers-Briggs
          and learning styles quizzes and have received different results, due to my different mindset when completing
          the quizzes. However, in saying that I do see truth in the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the Myers-Briggs 16 personalities strengths and weaknesses. When it comes to the strengths, I believe
          all bar Artisticare spot on. With the weaknesses, the majority also ring true to a degree, except for unpredictable and
          overly competitive. I feel the workplace habits are note worthy in regard to working within a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the learning styles quiz interesting, in the sense that it indicates I'm a bit of everything, which I
          do agree with when reading each style. I believe Reflector does represent me the most though, as indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed the Clifton Strengths a few months after starting my new job. Again these results mostly
          highlighted things I already knew about myself, for instance, at the top of the list, Harmony , which reiterates the fact, I don't enjoy conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't personally believe the results will necessarily influence my behaviour in a team. The results just
          confirm who I am as a person, ie - working together, rather than being controlled. The results have made me more aware,
          which may allow me to identify when my weaknesses are coming through before they take control.
        </p>
        <p>When forming a team, I believe it is best to have a mixture of people - ie different personalities and
          learning styles. Different ideals can complement each other, as different ideas and views can be put forward. However, mixing
          too many differences brings to mind 'too many cooks spoil the broth' and could actually result in conflict or
          personalities that clash. This needs to be considerd when forming a group.
